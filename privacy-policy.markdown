  CALIFORNIA ONLINE PRIVACY PROTECTION ACT\n\nCalOPPA is the first state law in the
  nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy.
  The law’s reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company
  in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting
  personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous
  privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and
  those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy.
  – See more at: [http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf](http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf)\n\n**According

  above.\n\n**Users will be notified of any privacy policy changes:** \n\n- On our
  Privacy Policy Page Users are able to change their personal information by emailing
  us.\n- How does our site handle do not track signals?\n- We honor do not track signals

  mechanism is in place.\n- Does our site allow third-party behavioral tracking?\n-
  It’s also important to note that we do not allow third-party behavioral tracking\n\n###
  COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)\n\nWhen it comes to the collection
  of personal information from children under 13, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection
  Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, the nation’s
  consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators
  of websites and online services must do to protect children’s privacy and safety
  online.\n\nWe do not specifically market to children under 13.\n\n### FAIR INFORMATION
  PRACTICES\n\nThe Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy
  law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant
  role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding
  the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical
  to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.\n\nIn
  order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive
  action, should a data breach occur:\nWe will notify the users via email\n\nWithin
  7 business days\nWe also agree to the Individual Redress Principle, which requires
  that individuals have a right to pursue legally enforceable rights against data
  collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires
  not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that
  individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or
  prosecute non-compliance by data processors.\n\n### CAN SPAM Act\n\nThe CAN-SPAM
  Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements
  for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from
  being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.\n\nWe collect
  your email address in order to:\n\n- Send information, respond to inquiries, and/or
  other requests or questions.\n- Process orders and to send information and updates
  pertaining to orders.\n- We may also send you additional information related to
  your product and/or service.\n- Market to our mailing list or continue to send emails
  to our clients after the original transaction has occurred.\n\nTo be in accordance
  with CANSPAM we agree to the following:\n\n- NOT use false or misleading subjects
  or email addresses.\n- Identify the message as an advertisement in some reasonable
  way.\n- Include the physical address of our business or site headquarters.\n- Monitor
  third-party email marketing services for compliance, if one is used.\n- Honor opt-out/unsubscribe
  requests quickly.\n- Allow users to unsubscribe by using the link at the bottom
