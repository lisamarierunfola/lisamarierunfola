            Throughout my life, there have been many twists, turns & grand leaps of faiths. I have made decisions and choices that others have deemed courageous and adventurous, and have gone through heartbreak, chaos and grief, with my feet on the ground and my eyes towards what’s next. Feeling stuck is exhausting — the dimness and disconnection every day, all while the to-do list is piling up — and the discontent it creates is pervasive. Moments like this have had an immeasurable impact on me not because of how low I felt, but because of how I turned hardships into triumphs that continue to enrich my life.
            <br><br>
            I live my life to the fullest, even during the most trying times. I have learned how to keep my mindset ignited, and now I am here to do the same for you. If you’ve ever felt like you were an adventurous soul just waiting for the right opportunity, here’s your sign.

        <p>I came to coaching because my life experiences showed me I needed new tools, or else I would suffocate under the pressure of life. Once I pulled myself out, I realized that others needed the same tools. My coaching style reflects these experiences. I know the darkness…and I absolutely know the light.
            <br><br>
            As a Certified Levin Life Coach, many of the resources I bring to our sessions are inspired by Nancy Levin’s boundary coaching methodology, developed by a best-selling author and master life coach.

            This style of coaching will give you a whole new definition of what life can offer. It will give you a whole new understanding of how you respond, react, and recharge. It will show you a whole new paradigm of who you can become.

            Our work together starts wherever you’re feeling stuck, overwhelmed, frustrated, or empty. We then dive deep into your fears and blocks. Part of this work is facing our story; part is getting unstuck; the rest is clear and healthy boundaries.
            <br><br>
            And I know, it is possible to feel more alive than you do right now.  Life can be more expansive and joyful than you could ever imagine.
