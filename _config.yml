description: Lisa Marie is your life ignitor and podcast host. Sheâ€™s a woman with
  a degree in CS (common sense, not computer science) who has experienced euphoric
  highs and agonizing lows on her journey. Grand leaps of faith have led her to the
  full life she leads today, and one of her missions is to share with others how she
  was able to pull herself out. If she can do it, so can you.
