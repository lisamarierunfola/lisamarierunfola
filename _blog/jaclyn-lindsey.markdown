  An author & keynote speaker, she sits on the board of Children in Conflict and is an advisor to Expectful. When she’s not in the middle of a pandemic, Jaclyn loves adventuring around with her husband, Mancel, and their two boys, Abel and River, and spending time with family, friends or strangers around a dinner table.
